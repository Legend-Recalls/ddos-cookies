      "synopsis": "It has been six months since Yoshiki Tsujinaka's best friend, Hikaru Indou, went missing in the mountains and returned a week later with no recollection of what had transpired. Certain that it is not the Hikaru he knows who came back, Yoshiki finally asks Hikaru about it. Suddenly, \"Hikaru\" reveals his true monstrous form and begs Yoshiki to keep it a secret, as he does not want to kill him.\n\nDespite his paranormal nature, \"Hikaru\" seems almost innocent, full of childlike wonder and eager to experience the summer heat, the countryside, and all kinds of other things in a human body for the first time. And for Yoshiki, it matters little if \"Hikaru\" is a fake relying on stolen memoriesâ€”as long as he never leaves again. As Yoshiki desperately clings to \"Hikaru\" in his intense grief, it becomes increasingly clear that something dangerous and supernatural may have descended from the mountains into their village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Rudo's biological father was one such person, having been thrown into the Abyss after he was accused of murder.\n\nOne day, after running into a mysterious figure on the way home, Rudo returns to find Regto's dying body on the floor. He is immediately found at the scene by the authorities and is charged with murder. No one believes his claims of innocence, and he is thrown into the Abyss.

In order to get his revenge on the one who killed Regto, Rudo reluctantly becomes a Cleaner to fight his way back up and out of the Abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, they have drifted apart from each other due to their overwhelming dedication to their fields, effectively turning them into strangers living under the same roof.\n\nEnter Yuu Ayase, the son of the late Subaru Ayase, a legendary actress who graduated from Saika. Unlike his mother, Yuu lacks any extraordinary talent whatsoever, much to the disappointment of those who knew her. Still, he transfers to her alma mater with one quiet promise in his heart: to fulfill her final wish that he build a true and happy family.\n\nIt just so happens that the Mikadono patriarch is also Subaru's longtime friend and benefactor, and he offers Yuu both a place to stay and a fresh start. Thrust into the lives of three estranged sisters who act cold toward him, Yuu may not be a genius himself, but the clumsy sincerity he brings might be what they all need to start anew.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
