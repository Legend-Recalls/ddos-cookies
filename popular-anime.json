      "synopsis": "In ancient China, during the Warring States period, a former servant named Xin rises through the ranks with a dream: to become the greatest general under the heavens. Fighting alongside King Ying Zheng of Qin—who seeks to unify China and end the chaos—Xin leads his own unit, the Fei Xin Force, onto the battlefield.\n\nWith power reclaimed from the influential Chancellor Buwei Lü, King Ying Zheng begins laying the groundwork for a new, unified legal state with the support of key allies like strategist Changping Jun and legalist Li Si.\n\nAs Qin launches a campaign to seize new territory from the state of Zhao, their advance is halted by the brilliant strategist, Li Mu. In response, Changping Jun devises a bold plan: to bypass Zhao's defenses and strike at the key city of Gyou, near Zhao's capital.\n\nTo carry out this risky maneuver, a powerful coalition army is formed—led by the tacticians Ou Sen (Wang Jian), Kan Ki (Huan Yi), and the warrior queen Yo Tan Wa (Yang Duanhe). Joining them are the next generation of Qin commanders: Xin's Fei Xin Force, Mou Ten (Meng Tian)'s Gaku Ka Unit, and Ou Hon (Wang Ben)'s Gyoku Hou Unit, each operating independently.\n\nThe fierce battle for Gyou begins, as the future of Qin's unification hangs in the balance.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

While his gaze is full of affection for Athanasia's older sister, Jennette Margarita, he only regards Athanasia with indifference and leaves her desperately yearning for his love. \n\nTo avert the fate that awaits her, the infant Athanasia resolves to escape the palace when she is older and, in the meantime, avoid meeting her father at all costs. However, their paths cross years before it was destined, and so young Athanasia finds herself at the mercy of Claude's seemingly mercurial whims. But the one emotion that she expects, apathy, is never present on his face. With a father who now considers her family, Athanasia strives to grow into a proper crown princess—but her grim vision may yet have ways to become true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "In a world filled with strange yet majestic creatures known as Pokémon, a new adventure begins! Hailing from the pristine region of Paldea, the timid Liko travels to the Kanto region to attend the Indigo Academy and become a Pokémon trainer—a person who forms relationships with Pokémon and trains them to participate in battles. Soon, Liko acquires Nyahoja, a fickle Grass-type cat Pokémon, as her first partner.\n\nPrior to Liko's transfer to Kanto, her grandmother gives her a uniquely patterned and gleaming pendant as a protective charm. However, an enigmatic organization—The Explorers—seems to know a secret about the pendant and nearly succeeds in stealing it from Liko. Fortunately, she is rescued by the Rising Volt Tacklers, a group of adventurers led by a Lizardon-riding trainer named Friede.\n\nAfter a series of encounters with The Explorers, Liko decides to join Friede's team, accompanying him and his crew members on a grand journey across the regions. Along the way, they aim to unravel not only the mysteries of the world of Pokémon, but also the power that resides within her pendant.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Everything he says somehow turns prophetic, which convinces everyone around him that he possesses unfathomable wisdom regardless of his utter incompetence. Krai knows his success is only a series of coincidences, but the weight of those expectations grows heavier as time goes by. Unfortunately, as the other members of the Grieving Souls continue to shock the world with their achievements, Krai's wish for a peaceful retirement drifts ever further out of reach.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
