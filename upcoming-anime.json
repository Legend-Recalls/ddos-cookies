Through the \"Authority of Gluttony,\" Rem was put into suspended animation, while Crusch's memories and even Juliusâ€™s name were devoured. As he searches for a way to save them, Subaru learns of the \"wise man\" Shaulaâ€”an all-seeing being said to possess every form of knowledge. His next destination is the Pleiades Watchtower, home to a wise man, the farthest tower standing in the vast, uncharted desert known as the Auguria Dunesâ€”a place so perilous that even the mightiest \"Sword Saint,\" Reinhard, failed to conquer it. The fury of nature, unknown magical beasts, and unimaginable dangers lie ahead. Together with his friends, Subaru embarks on a life-risking journey to reclaim what was lost.\n\n(Source: Kadokawa)",

      "synopsis": "Fate/strange Fake centers around an imperfect copy of a Grail War based on the Third Holy Grail War in Fuyuki. Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Thousands line up in San Diego to travel over six thousand kilometers for a chance to win the grand prize of fifty million dollars. With the era of the horse reaching its end, contestants are allowed to use any kind of vehicle they wish. Competitors will have to endure grueling conditions, traveling up to a hundred kilometers a day through uncharted wastelands. The Steel Ball Run is truly a one-of-a-kind event.\n\nThe youthful Johnny Joestar, a crippled former horse racer, has come to San Diego to watch the start of the race. There he encounters Gyro Zeppeli, a racer with two steel balls at his waist instead of a gun. Johnny witnesses Gyro using one of his steel balls to unleash a fantastical power, compelling a man to fire his gun at himself during a duel. In the midst of the action, Johnny happens to touch the steel ball and feels a power surging through his legs, allowing him to stand up for the first time in two years. Vowing to find the secret of the steel balls, Johnny decides to compete in the race, and so begins his bizarre adventure across America on the Steel Ball Run.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "Kim Dokja does not consider himself the protagonist of his own life. Befitting the name his parents gave him, he is a solitary person whose sole hobby is reading web novels. For over a decade, he has lived vicariously through Yoo Joonghyuk, the main character of the web novel Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse (TWSA). Through Joonghyuk, Dokja has experienced secondhand the trials of repeatedly regressing in time, in search of an end to life-threatening \"scenarios\" that force people to act out narratives for the amusement of god-like \"Constellations.\"\n\nAfter reading 3,149 chaptersâ€”long after all other readers lost interestâ€”Dokja finally resigns himself to the story ending. However, he receives an enigmatic message from the author, stating that the story will soon be monetized, before his surroundings suddenly go dark. He swiftly realizes that fiction has become reality and he is now living through TWSA. Although he is the singular omniscient reader of the events yet to come, his success in the scenarios is not guaranteedâ€”but perhaps his advantage will empower him to step into the protagonist role that never suited him before. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is in these direst of circumstances that he meets Teoritta, one of the world's strongest weapons. \"When every last enemy has been defeated, you are to shower me with praise and pat my head.\" In order to survive and to take revenge on those who wronged him, he makes a pact with the goddess and launches headfirst into a maelstrom of war and intrigue.\n\n(Source: Official site, edited)",

In an orphanage that raises children as soldiers, death is nothing new to the residents. With their home country embroiled in a war that has dragged on for too many years and shows no signs of stopping, the institution's children are sent off to die in battle every day. In contrast to the other orphans, Sheena is deeply disturbed by the ongoing conflict and wishes for it to end.\n\nOn the night of her roommate's death, Sheena met a blood-covered girl who remained jubilant despite the condition she was in. The next day, the girl appears as a new student in Sheena's class and introduces herself as Mimi Kagari. Initially thought to be a school myth, Mimi is said to be the secret weapon of the orphanageâ€”a girl who cannot die. Assigned as Sheena's new roommate, Mimi hopes to get along with her and get accustomed to school life.\n\nHowever, unsettled by Mimi's carefree attitude toward the war, Sheena struggles to accept the world they live in, all while their unusual friendship flourishes amid the bleak situation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
